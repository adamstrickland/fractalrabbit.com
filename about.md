After graduating high school at age 9, Adam moved to Alaska to work on the crab boats and save money for college.  Near the end of his second season, he was swept overboard by a rogue wave.  Thanks to some guy with a red cape and a strong jaw, he survived and decided to call his crab fishing days over.

By 13, Adam had solved the Riemann Hypothesis, but didn't get credit for it when the cat knocked over a candle and burned the house down.

For some reason, Adam decided to go to the University of Texas at Austin and pursue a degree in German, of all things.  Okay, so German happened when he was involved in a dispute with the English department over the use of the Oxford comma and was forced to leave the degree program.

Despite the stratospheric career heights offered by being barely competent in a language spoken by roughly 100 million people, Adam decided to pursue a career in software development.  He signed on with a quirky outfit in the DC area called Fu Associates, and quickly proceeded to learn a lot of stuff while producing little of signifcance.

Shortly after the advent of the new millenium, the young man and his new wife moved to Dallas where they've suffered through 16 atrocious summers of infernal temperatures, brobdingnian hailstorms and at least a couple country-western extravaganzas.  Along the way, Adam has managed to forge a career in software, designing and implementing distributed systems for various clients, as well as founding a couple of vaguely successful startups, all while inventing a ground-breaking social media site primarily used for shilling pyramid-scheme casual games and promoting vapid listicles, only to be beaten to the punch by an MIT-educate auteur.  Since joining WellMatch/iTriage, he has formed a purple robes society and endlessly railed against the use of bash scripts.

In his spare time, Adam enjoys practicing martial arts, mixing cocktails, playing charades and, (notice the use of the Oxford comma there!) on occasion, pondering the question for which the answer is 42.
