Today represents a scary day for me.  This post, this brief message, is, for me, anxiety-inducing.

Writing for me has always been a solitary activity.  Not that I've ever been prolific.  At best, I tend to be judicious with my use of words.  And over the last 15 years, I've preferred to proselytize in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), [Java](http://java.com), and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com), rather than in English.  However, for a couple of reasons, that absence needs to come to its end.

It used to be that I was a pretty good amateur writer.  Nothing award-winning, mind you, but decent enough.  At one point during university, I was directly encouraged, even challenged, to become a writer. And for many reasons, I did not answer that call. It's a decision that I can't say I regret, but there has always been that feeling of what-if, what if i had taken that path...

I could talk about why...  Why was I scared to embark on the journey of the long-form author?  Why did I abandon something that I not only found solace in, and that I was reasonably competent in?  I honestly can't say; it's been some time.  I could speculate - and maybe at some point on this journey I will - but no one wants to read that shit (not that this will ever be read, either, eh?).

So here it is... All journeys begin with a single step, and with a single step we begin.  Let's get this party started.
