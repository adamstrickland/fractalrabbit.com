Mmm, the Negroni.  My favorite classic cocktail. Its enticing red hue, the alluring aroma of orange and allspice, its magical bittersweet mouthfeel.  The perfect mixed drink, in my not-so-humble opinion.  It's a wonderful aperitif, exciting the taste buds for the meal that is to come.  It's a good choice with which to fade the day away; the bitterness will keep you from downing them like so many appletinis, and yet it never overwhelms - it's a marathon, not a sprint, after all.  And the Negroni is a fantastic last-call, a lingering miasma of flavor that softens the blow at 2am.

Le sigh.

But this is not noteworthy.  All of these things have been said before, about the Negroni or otherwise, so why should you care?  What is the point, other than to confess my undying love to the greater world, that world that cares not a bit for my ministrations?

Maybe, just maybe, we can improve on this bad boy.

I know, blasphemy.  But in a world where everythihng is derivative, why the fuck not?  We may find something that, while possibly not as versatile, as universal, as the Negroni, has a place in certain situations, for certain palates, where it can be king, if only for a day.

## The Boulevardier

Likely the best-known derivative of the Negroni is the highly-esteemed Boulevardier.  It is my opinion that there are times when this is the better beverage of the two.  However, due to the violence inherent in Bourbon, I have found the margin of error when mixing a Boulevardier to be much narrower.  In other words, they can be fantastic, but it is much easier to fuck this one up.

If I'm out and about, I will really only order a Boulevardier from a bartender that I trust.  I mean, it's not like [Bourdain's advice on mussels](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/12/features.weekend1), but it's close, amirite?  In all seriousness, no one's going to die, of course, but it's hard to fuck up a Negroni - equal parts, heavy as you wanna be - so why risk it?  That being said, man, it can be eye-opening.
